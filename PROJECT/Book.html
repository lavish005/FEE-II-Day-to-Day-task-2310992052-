                <p><b>SUMMARY: </b>It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. 

                    Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable— sometimes it isn't even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s  how  the math works out: if you can  get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.
                    
                    It doesn't matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. 
                    
                    Focus on getting 1 percent better every day. 
                    
                    Lesson 2: Forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. 
                    
                    Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
                    
                    If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.
                    
                    You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
                    
                    Atomic Habits presents a proven system for building good habits and breaking bad ones.
                    
                    Lesson 3: Build identity-based habits
                    
                    The key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe that you are (either consciously or subconsciously).
                    
                    To change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself. You need to build identity-based habits.
                    
                    Changing your beliefs isn't nearly as hard as you might think. There are two steps.
                    
                    Decide the type of person you want to be.
                    Prove it to yourself with small wins.
                    Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
                    
                    How to build better habits in 4 simple steps
                    This section of the Atomic Habits summary presents key points from the actionable strategies in the book, organized around a framework called the Four Laws of Behavior Change.   
                    
                    The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. 
                    
                    Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it.

                <p><b>SUMMARY: </b>The Alchemist is a novel published in 1988 and written by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho. The novel was originally published in Portuguese but was later translated into other languages as it gained popularity worldwide. There is also a short story within American literature by the same name; however, "The Alchemist" short story was written by American author H.P. Lovecraft and published in 1916. Although some readers may think of Coelho's The Alchemist as a short story, it is considered a novel because of the length of the work—nearly 200 pages. The novel is a modern classic that spans the genres of literary fiction, fantasy fiction, and adventure fiction.

                    What is the book The Alchemist about? The main character is a Spanish shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his home in Andalusia to the pyramids in Egypt in search of the treasure of his dreams and his own Personal Legend. Throughout his journey across the Saharan Desert, Santiago meets several characters who help guide him and give him advice. Santiago eventually realizes that the treasure he seeks is not buried at the Egyptian pyramids but in his very own hometown in Spain, where he then returns and finds the hidden treasure.
                    antiago is a shepherd boy living in Andalusia, Spain. At the beginning of Part One, Santiago is sleeping in the ruins of an abandoned church beneath a sycamore tree and experiences a recurring dream as he sleeps. When he wakes, he travels with his sheep to the Andalusian town of Tarifa, where he visits a fortuneteller to interpret his dream. Santiago explains that, in his dream, an unknown child leads him to the Egyptian pyramids and tells him that there is hidden treasure there. However, Santiago never learns the exact location of the treasure because his dream always ends before the child tells him. In exchange for one-tenth of the treasure, the fortuneteller advises Santiago to go to Egypt to look for his treasure near the pyramids.

Soon after, Santiago meets an older man named Melchizedek, who claims to be the King of Salem and knows every detail about Santiago's life. Melchizedek explains the idea of a Personal Legend and causes Santiago to consider his own Personal Legend. In exchange for one-tenth of Santiago's flock of sheep, Melchizedek reveals to Santiago that the treasure is hidden in the pyramids of Egypt. After selling his entire flock of sheep, Santiago uses the money to travel to Tangier, Morocco, to pursue his Personal Legend of finding the hidden treasure. Moments after arriving in Tangier, Santiago is robbed by a thief who takes all of his money. To earn back the money to pay for a guide to the pyramids.

                <p><b>SUMMARY: </b>
                    1. No One’s Crazy
Summary: Everyone looks at money through the lens of their past experiences.

You can read what it was like to lose everything during, say, The Great Recession, but you will never bear the emotional scars of those who survived it and are now afraid to invest again. It’s important to remember, then, that until you’ve lived through a financial crisis and felt its consequences, you will never understand why people behave the way they do. 

2. Luck & Risk
Big idea: Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.

Every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. Bill Gates had a competitive advantage over millions of other students because he attended one of the only high schools in the world that had the cash and foresight to buy a computer. In finance, luck is as much a force as risk.

3. Never Enough
Big idea: Rich people do crazy things.

Rajat Guptas. Bernie Madoff. These are men that had everything— wealth, power, freedom—only to lose everything because they had no sense of enough. The lesson? There is no need to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need. The hardest financial skill, it seems, is to stop the goalposts from moving.  

4. Confounding Compounding
Big Idea: Our minds are not built to handle the reality that compounding leads to logic-defying results.

Warren Buffett’s fortune isn’t due to just being a good investor. Rather it’s due to being a good investor since he was a child. As of writing, Warren Buffett’s net worth is $84.5 billion. Of that, $84.2 billion was accumulated after his 50th birthday. The counterintuitive nature of compounding leads even the smartest of us to overlook its enormous power.

5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy
Big idea: Good investing is not about making good decisions. It’s about consistently not screwing up.

Housel writes that if he had to summarize money success in a single word, it would be “survival.” Not “growth” “brains” or “insight,” but “survival.” The ability to stick around for a long time without wiping out or being forced to give up makes the biggest difference when it comes to making money. Compounding only works if you can give assets years to grow.
